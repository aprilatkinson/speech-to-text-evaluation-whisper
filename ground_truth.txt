I’m a senior go-to-market and commercial leader with more than fourteen years of experience driving revenue and growth across global consumer brands, SaaS, ad tech, and AI-enabled platforms.

My work has focused on building and operating end-to-end go-to-market systems, from positioning and demand generation through pipeline management, sales execution, and revenue governance, typically in complex, multi-region environments.

I originally started in hands-on performance marketing and later moved into head of marketing roles, before expanding into sales and revenue leadership. That transition was driven by the need to resolve execution gaps between marketing, sales, product, and operations as organizations scaled.

Over time, this shaped me into a commercially grounded operator with direct ownership of pipeline quality, forecasting discipline, regional performance, and post-acquisition go-to-market integration.

I’m known for restoring decision clarity and execution cadence in ambiguous environments, helping leadership teams unify fragmented go-to-market motions and stabilize growth during transformation or scale-up phases.
